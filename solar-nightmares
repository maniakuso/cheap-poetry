The invoice of emptiness, a ravaged disconnect looms near. This is the anchor of our freedom, 
of a storm to grasp at ankles. And to wait alone in the dark. For what lurks beyond the warm interior. 
For a passage to a new light. And the further heat that spreads up the side of your body in a warm
flash. A trace of the injection buried in the open flesh. 

A wave of fabric against waist. Of plaid pushed to the side. And a droplet of rain. Of dew stuck
to the side of her leg. You've become a lapping cry, a ripple of unsung properties. Lean into the 
rubble. And fall. Learn to rip cords from the dirt and inject those old streams into your chest. 
Lean how to program yourself to scream delicately.
